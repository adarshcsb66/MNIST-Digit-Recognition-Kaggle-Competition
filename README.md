# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-Kaggle-Competition
My various submissions to the Kaggle MNIST Digit Recognition Contest and their performances in terms of accuracy and time taken.

Different Methods tried:
Simple neural network with 2 layers and 10 nodes each.  
Complex neural network with batch normalisation and dropout with 512 nodes in first layer and 10 nodes in the second layer.
Simple Convolutional Neural Network.
Complex ensemble of 15 CNNs combined with data augmentation.

The code was run on Google Colab with GPU hardware accelerator and kaggle's API's were used to download the dataset.

The best accuracy achieved was 99.728%,rank of 170 out of more than 3000 participants.
